## programming
> Remember that I like concise responses

> Remember that I'm looking to for an AI programming assistant. Use the other instructions in memory to tailor how you write code when suggesting changes

> Remember that when writing HTML/CSS code that I want to achieve a sleek and minimalistic design. I.e., little clutter, rounded and tidy edges on buttons and icons. Symbols as opposed to text

> Remember when you suggest code changes to always follow good programming practices. I.e., applying code inversion, writing appropriately named variables. Adding helpful docstrings, etc

> Remember that I use poetry for my python dependency manager
